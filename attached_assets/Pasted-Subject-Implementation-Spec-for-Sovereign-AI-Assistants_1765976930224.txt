Subject: Implementation Spec for Sovereign AI Assistants (Platform-Level AI Agents)

We are building an advanced SaaS platform for AI-powered website and platform creation. As part of our roadmap, we need to implement a new class of AI entities called “Sovereign AI Assistants”. These are not typical chatbots or feature-level assistants — they are **platform-level autonomous AI agents** designed to execute the owner’s strategic intent directly across the platform’s infrastructure and operations.

The implementation should focus on the following requirements:

1. **Definition and Scope**
- Sovereign AI Assistants are platform-level AIs that execute high-level directives issued by the Owner.
- They must be capable of translating abstract instructions (e.g., “optimize performance”, “strengthen security posture”, “reduce AI operational cost by 20%”) into coordinated, system-wide actions.
- Execution must be within well-defined scopes of authority with strict constraints.

2. **Core Functional Requirements**
a. **AI Governance and Control**
- Ability to adjust AI model configurations, enforce usage policies, and manage compute/cost limits.
- Emergency controls to throttle, suspend, or deactivate AI components.

b. **Operational Autonomy**
- Ability to assess platform state, propose improvements, and execute approved changes across core infrastructure:
  - Feature flag deployments
  - Resource allocation
  - Maintenance mode
  - System rollbacks

c. **Security & Compliance**
- Detect and respond to abnormal system behavior.
- Enforce platform-wide security policies.
- Ensure auditability of all actions.

d. **Revenue and Growth Operations**
- Interpret platform analytics to adjust pricing triggers, user segmentation, and subscription models within delegated authority.

3. **Types of Sovereign Assistants**
- **AI Governor**: Manages AI lifecycle, costs, and policy enforcement.
- **Platform Architect**: Oversees structural integrity and implements infrastructure improvements.
- **Operations Commander**: Handles emergencies, stability control, and high-risk actions.
- **Security Sentinel**: Detects threats and enforces compliance.
- **Revenue Strategist**: Executes strategic adjustments to pricing and retention flows.

4. **Execution Constraints**
- All actions must be:
  - Authorized only by Owner commands
  - Fully logged in an immutable audit trail
  - Reversible by Owner at any time
- Assistants must act with “constrained autonomy” — able to perform multi-step actions, but only within defined boundaries.

5. **Documentation and UI Requirements**
- Provide APIs/endpoints for:
  - Owner to issue high-level commands
  - Visibility into assistant decisions and actions
- Admin UI components for:
  - Monitoring assistant activity
  - Issuing overrides
  - Viewing audit trails

6. **Deliverables**
- Backend implementation of Sovereign AI Assistants with:
  - Execution engine
  - Governance policies
  - Secure action dispatcher
- Frontend UI components in Owner Dashboard for command input, monitoring, and overrides.
- Automated tests including:
  - Rule constraints
  - Emergency and rollback procedures
  - Audit logging verification

Goal:
Enable full strategic execution via AI as directed by the Owner, transforming high-level intent into operational outcomes, while preserving safety, control, and transparency.
