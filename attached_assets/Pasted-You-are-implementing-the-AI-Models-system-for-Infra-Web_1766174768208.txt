You are implementing the AI Models system for Infra Web Nova.

IMPORTANT:
This system MUST be fully dynamic and owner-controlled.
No AI model names may be hardcoded in services or business logic.

==================================================
CORE RULE
==================================================
AI models are managed ONLY through the Owner Account.
Developers do NOT modify code to add or change models.

==================================================
MODEL REGISTRY (DYNAMIC)
==================================================
Implement a dynamic AI Model Registry backed by a database.

Each model must store:
- Internal model ID (Nova ID)
- Display name
- Provider type (initially: replit)
- Provider model name (exact Replit name)
- Enabled / Disabled
- Recommended flag
- Capabilities (chat, code, reasoning, etc.)

Models can be:
- Added
- Edited
- Disabled
ONLY by the Owner account via UI.

==================================================
PROVIDER ABSTRACTION
==================================================
Infra Web Nova must NOT depend directly on Replit.

Implement a Provider Adapter layer:
- ReplitAdapter (initial)
- Future adapters can replace it without changing core logic

Core logic calls:
callModel(provider, providerModelName, payload)

==================================================
SERVICE MODEL RESOLUTION
==================================================
Services must NOT select models directly.

For each request:
1. Resolve model from Service Config (DB)
2. If unavailable → fallback
3. If unavailable → global default

==================================================
GLOBAL & SERVICE SETTINGS
==================================================
Owner can manage:
- Global default model
- Emergency kill switch
- Token limits
- Service → Model mapping
- Fallback behavior

==================================================
VALIDATION
==================================================
- Block AI calls if no active model exists
- Block startup if owner disabled all models
- Validate provider model name before saving
- Replit model names must be stored EXACTLY

==================================================
GOAL
==================================================
Infra Web Nova must be able to:
- Add new models without code changes
- Switch providers without rewriting services
- Remain independent from Replit in the future

This is a production system.
Hardcoding model names or bypassing the registry is forbidden.
