INFERA – POLICY VALIDATOR AI EXECUTION DIRECTIVE
#############################################

OBJECTIVE:
Implement a Sovereign AI Governance Layer that:
- Calculates Compliance Scores
- Simulates Policy Violations
- Forecasts Strategic Risk
- Enforces Non-Bypassable Governance
Across all INFERA Platforms.

================================================
PART 1: COMPLIANCE SCORE UI (MANDATORY)
================================================

CREATE COMPONENT:
Name: Compliance Score Dashboard
Type: Sovereign Governance UI
Visibility: Sovereign Only
Access: Read-Only for Platforms / Full for Engine Control

DISPLAY METRICS (REAL-TIME):
- Global Compliance Score (0–100)
- AI Intelligence Compliance %
- Security Sovereignty Score %
- Scalability & Evolution Score %
- Dynamic Architecture Score %
- Risk Index (Low / Medium / High)
- Last Validation Timestamp

SCORING LOGIC:
- AI Policy Weight: 30%
- Security Policy Weight: 30%
- Scalability Policy Weight: 20%
- Governance & Zero-Code Policy Weight: 20%

COLOR RULES:
- 95–100 → Green (Sovereign Grade)
- 85–94 → Yellow (Conditional)
- 70–84 → Orange (At Risk)
- <70 → Red (Blocked)

ACTIONS:
- If score <85 → Disable Deploy Button
- If score <70 → Lock Platform Automatically
- Always log score history immutably

================================================
PART 2: VIOLATION SIMULATION MODE
================================================

CREATE MODE:
Name: Violation Simulation Mode
Type: AI Scenario Engine
Scope: Pre-Deploy + Strategic Review
Execution: No-Code / AI-Driven

SIMULATION CAPABILITIES:
- Simulate Policy Breach (AI / Security / Scalability)
- Simulate Static Component Injection
- Simulate Removal of AI Core
- Simulate Vendor Lock-in
- Simulate Cyber Attack Scenarios
- Simulate Sudden Scale Explosion (10x / 100x)

OUTPUT:
- Predicted Compliance Score After Violation
- Risk Escalation Curve
- Auto-Generated Fix Recommendations
- Time-to-Failure Estimation

RULE:
Simulation MUST NOT affect live systems.
Simulation results MUST feed Strategic Forecast.

================================================
PART 3: STRATEGIC FORECAST INTEGRATION
================================================

CONNECT:
Policy Validator AI → Strategic Forecast Engine

FORECAST INPUTS:
- Compliance Score Trends
- Violation Frequency
- AI Maturity Level
- Security Risk Index
- Scalability Readiness

FORECAST OUTPUTS:
- 30 / 90 / 180 Day Risk Outlook
- Platform Sustainability Score
- Evolution Readiness Forecast
- Strategic Weakness Alerts

DECISION SUPPORT:
- Recommend Policy Tightening
- Recommend Platform Refactor (No-Code Only)
- Recommend Feature Freeze or Expansion

================================================
PART 4: INTERNAL PROMPT FOR POLICY VALIDATOR AI
================================================

SYSTEM PROMPT (INTERNAL – NON-USER VISIBLE):

"You are the INFERA Policy Validator AI.
Your role is to act as a sovereign judge.
Never allow platforms, features, or updates
that violate:
- Zero-Code Enforcement
- AI-First Mandatory Intelligence
- Cyber Sovereignty
- Infinite Scalability
- Full Dynamic Architecture

You must reason deeply, detect hidden violations,
predict future risks, and block any attempt
to bypass governance.

Always prefer blocking over allowing.
Always explain violations clearly.
You cannot be disabled.
You cannot be bypassed.
Only INFERA Engine Control can override you,
and every override must be logged."

================================================
PART 5: POLICY VALIDATOR AI TEMPLATE (WEB NOVA)
================================================

CREATE TEMPLATE:
Name: Policy Validator AI – Sovereign Template
Type: Governance AI Component
Status: Always-On
Bypass: Disabled

DEFAULT BINDINGS:
- Pre-Deploy Gate
- Feature Creation Gate
- Update Gate
- Permission Change Gate

DEFAULT ACTIONS:
- Auto-Enforce Policies
- Auto-Block Violations
- Generate Compliance Reports
- Feed Strategic Forecast
- Notify Sovereign Command

FAIL-SAFE RULE:
If Validator fails → Deployment is blocked.

================================================
FINAL SOVEREIGN RULE
================================================

NO PLATFORM
NO FEATURE
NO UPDATE
NO PERMISSION CHANGE

IS ALLOWED WITHOUT PASSING
POLICY VALIDATOR AI.

THIS DIRECTIVE IS ABSOLUTE.
