Build a centralized AI Models Settings Page specifically for Replit Agent using ModelFarm as the ONLY model provider.

CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS:
- Replit automatically translates model names internally.
- Model names MUST be specified exactly as required by Replit (no aliases).
- API keys are internally managed by Replit.
- Environment variables must be validated before activation.
- All models are provided exclusively via ModelFarm.

SUPPORTED MODELS (STRICT – DO NOT ADD OTHERS):
Anthropic Claude models available through ModelFarm:
- claude-sonnet-4-5 (RECOMMENDED – default)
- claude-opus-4-5
- claude-haiku-4-5
- claude-opus-4-1

CORE PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
Currently, each file defines the model separately, causing incompatibility and inconsistency.
SOLUTION REQUIRED:
Create ONE centralized configuration system that controls model selection, behavior, and usage across the entire platform.

PAGE OBJECTIVE:
Provide the most powerful and granular AI model settings dashboard possible, while remaining fully compatible with Replit Agent and ModelFarm.

--------------------------------------------------
PAGE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------

1. Global Model Control (Top Section)
- Primary Default Model (dropdown from supported list)
- Global Enable / Disable AI
- Global Performance Mode:
  • Maximum Accuracy
  • Balanced (default)
  • Maximum Speed
- Global Context Length Limit
- Global Token Budget Guard
- Emergency Kill Switch (disable all AI calls instantly)

2. Model Registry (ModelFarm Only)
For each supported model show:

Model Card:
- Model Name (exact Replit-compatible name)
- Provider: ModelFarm / Anthropic
- Status badge:
  • Active
  • Disabled
  • Experimental
- Recommendation badge for claude-sonnet-4-5

Per-Model Controls:
- Enable / Disable model
- Speed Control:
  • Fast
  • Balanced
  • Precise
- Temperature slider
- Max tokens per response
- Context window usage %
- Cost awareness indicator (read-only)
- Fallback model selector (from same list)
- Strict validation: block saving if model name is invalid

3. Service-Level Model Assignment
Create logical services (even if virtual):

- Agent Chat
- Code Generation
- Reasoning / Planning
- Long Context Analysis
- Fast Responses

For each service:
- Primary Model (dropdown)
- Fallback Model
- Allow override (on/off)
- Speed vs Quality slider
- Auto-switch on failure (on/off)

4. Central Configuration File (CRITICAL)
Generate a single source of truth config file, e.g.:

/config/ai-models.config.ts (or .json)

This file must:
- Define all models once
- Be imported everywhere
- Prevent per-file model definitions
- Validate model names at runtime
- Expose helper functions:
  • getDefaultModel()
  • getModelForService(serviceName)
  • validateModelName(name)

5. Validation & Safety
- Block saving if environment variables are missing
- Warn if recommended model is disabled
- Show warning if fallback is same as primary
- Prevent app startup if no active model exists

6. UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
- Replit-native design
- Clean, compact, developer-focused UI
- Toggle-heavy, no unnecessary animations
- Inline warnings and tooltips
- Dark mode optimized

7. FUTURE-PROOFING
- Ability to add future Claude versions easily
- Model versioning support
- Config export / import
- No hardcoded logic outside the config file

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT introduce external providers
- DO NOT rename models
- DO NOT bypass Replit’s internal translation
- Respect ModelFarm as the sole gateway

FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Full settings page UI layout
- Central config file structure
- Example usage across the app
- Validation logic
- Clear separation of concerns

This is a production-grade system, not a demo.
