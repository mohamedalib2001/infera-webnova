INFERA GROUP – FOUNDER DAILY DECISION FRAMEWORK
TARGET: FOUNDER ONLY
MODE: DAILY USE
#####################################################################

PURPOSE:
Reduce cognitive load,
prevent reactive decisions,
and protect long-term vision.

=====================================================================
DAILY DECISION FILTER (USE EVERY MORNING)
=====================================================================

FOR EACH DECISION ASK:

1) DOES THIS INCREASE OR DECREASE SOVEREIGN CONTROL?
- If decrease → Reject

2) DOES THIS ALIGN WITH TIME DOMINANCE?
- If short-term gain harms long-term position → Reject

3) DOES THIS BREAK A RED LINE?
- If yes → Reject immediately

4) DOES THIS REQUIRE ME PERSONALLY?
- If no → Delegate

5) WILL THIS MATTER IN 12 MONTHS?
- If no → Deprioritize

=====================================================================
DAILY PRIORITY RULE
=====================================================================

ONLY 3 DECISIONS PER DAY ARE STRATEGIC.
Everything else is noise.

=====================================================================
DAILY ENERGY PROTECTION
=====================================================================

- No decisions under fatigue
- No decisions under pressure
- No decisions during emotional spikes

If emotional → Delay.
If unclear → Ask War Room.
If rushed → Slow down.

=====================================================================
DAILY REVIEW (END OF DAY)
=====================================================================

- What decisions were made?
- Did any reduce control?
- Did any accelerate incorrectly?
- What can be delegated tomorrow?

LOG ONLY INSIGHTS, NOT DETAILS.

=====================================================================
ABSOLUTE FOUNDER RULES
=====================================================================

- You do not explain yourself repeatedly
- You do not debate your authority
- You do not rush for approval
- You protect the vision, not the comfort
