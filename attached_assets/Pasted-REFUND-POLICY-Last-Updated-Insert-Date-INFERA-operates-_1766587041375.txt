REFUND POLICY

Last Updated: [Insert Date]

INFERA operates as a sovereign digital infrastructure.
Accordingly, refund policies are governed
by access type, service scope, and contractual agreements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GENERAL PRINCIPLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------

INFERA does not operate as a consumer service.
Most services are provisioned based on
approved access, configuration, and governance setup.

Refunds are therefore limited and conditional.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. NON-REFUNDABLE SERVICES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are strictly non-refundable:

- Sovereign or enterprise licenses
- Activated platforms or modules
- Custom configurations or deployments
- Pilot environments once activated
- Usage-based or consumption-based services
- Services involving AI model initialization or training

Once access is granted or a system is activated,
the service is considered delivered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. CONDITIONAL REFUNDS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refunds may be considered ONLY if:
- Access was granted in error
- Payment was duplicated
- A technical failure on INFERA’s side
  prevented initial access entirely

Any refund request must be submitted
within a defined review window
and is subject to validation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. REVIEW & APPROVAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

All refund requests are:
- Reviewed manually
- Assessed under governance and security rules
- Approved or rejected at INFERA’s sole discretion

Approval of one request
does not establish precedent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. TERMINATION & SUSPENSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Account suspension or termination
due to policy violations,
security concerns,
or governance decisions
does not entitle the user to a refund.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. CONTRACTUAL OVERRIDES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If a separate written agreement exists
(e.g., enterprise or government contract),
refund terms in that agreement
override this policy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
7. PROCESS & CONTACT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refund requests must be submitted through:
billing@infera.com

Requests must include:
- Account identifier
- Service details
- Reason for request

Incomplete requests may not be reviewed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

INFERA prioritizes
governance integrity and system stability
over transactional convenience.
