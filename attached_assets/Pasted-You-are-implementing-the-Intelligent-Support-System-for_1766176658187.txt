You are implementing the Intelligent Support System for Infra Web Nova.

Infra Web Nova is a sovereign-grade platform that integrates AI deeply
into every operational layer.

Your task is to build a next-generation Support & Operations System
that combines human agents, AI models, automation, and analytics
into one unified experience.

==================================================
CORE VISION
==================================================
This is NOT a traditional support ticket system.

This is:
- AI-augmented
- Context-aware
- Multi-role
- Self-improving
- Deeply integrated into Infra Web Nova Core

==================================================
SUPPORT ACTORS
==================================================

1. End User
- Submits support requests
- Chats with AI or human agents
- Sees real-time status and history

2. Support Agent
- Uses an intelligent dashboard
- Assisted by AI copilots
- Handles tickets, chats, escalations

3. Support Supervisor
- Monitors performance
- Manages agents
- Controls AI behavior

4. Platform Owner
- Full visibility
- Policy control
- AI governance

==================================================
SUPPORT CHANNELS
==================================================

Implement multiple support channels:
- Live Chat
- AI Chat (Self-service)
- Ticket System
- System Alerts
- Internal Notes (agent-only)

All channels must be unified under ONE system.

==================================================
INTELLIGENT TICKET & CHAT SYSTEM
==================================================

Each support interaction must be treated as a "Support Session".

A Support Session includes:
- User identity
- Organization
- Platform context (page, service, error, logs)
- Conversation history
- AI involvement level
- Assigned agent (if any)
- Priority & SLA
- Status lifecycle

==================================================
AI-FIRST SUPPORT FLOW
==================================================

Default behavior:
1. User starts a support request
2. AI Support Assistant engages FIRST
3. AI attempts:
   - Problem understanding
   - Knowledge base lookup
   - System diagnostics
   - Resolution suggestion

If AI confidence < threshold:
→ Escalate to Human Agent

==================================================
AI CAPABILITIES (MANDATORY)
==================================================

The AI Support Assistant must:
- Understand Infra Web Nova services
- Access system logs (read-only)
- Analyze errors & configurations
- Suggest fixes step-by-step
- Summarize issues for human agents
- Auto-tag issues (billing, AI, API, security, UI, etc.)
- Detect urgency and risk

==================================================
SMART ROUTING & ESCALATION
==================================================

Implement intelligent routing:
- Based on issue type
- Based on customer plan
- Based on agent skills
- Based on SLA

AI must recommend:
- Best agent
- Priority level
- Estimated resolution time

==================================================
SUPPORT AGENT DASHBOARD (CRITICAL)
==================================================

Build an advanced Support Agent Control Panel with:

- Live queue
- Active chats
- Ticket inbox
- AI-generated summaries
- Suggested responses
- One-click actions
- Internal notes
- Knowledge base suggestions

Each agent MUST see:
- Which AI model is assisting
- AI confidence level
- AI recommendation source

==================================================
AI COPILOT FOR AGENTS
==================================================

Each support agent has an AI Copilot that:
- Suggests replies
- Summarizes long conversations
- Drafts technical responses
- Flags risks or policy violations
- Learns from resolved tickets

==================================================
KNOWLEDGE BASE (SELF-IMPROVING)
==================================================

Implement a Knowledge Base that:
- Is used by AI first
- Is updated from resolved tickets
- Can be edited by supervisors
- Supports versioning
- Supports multi-language

==================================================
OBSERVABILITY & ANALYTICS
==================================================

Provide dashboards for:
- Response times
- Resolution rates
- AI vs Human resolution ratio
- Agent performance
- Customer satisfaction
- Recurring issues
- AI accuracy over time

==================================================
SECURITY & GOVERNANCE
==================================================

- Role-based access (User / Agent / Supervisor / Owner)
- Full audit logs
- Sensitive data masking
- AI decision traceability
- Manual override at any point

==================================================
UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

- Dark-mode first
- Clean, professional, enterprise UI
- Real-time updates
- Clear AI vs Human indicators
- Minimal friction
- Multilingual support (Arabic first-class)

==================================================
INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

The Support System MUST integrate with:
- User accounts
- Organizations
- Subscriptions
- AI Models Registry
- Service Registry
- System Logs
- Billing & Usage

==================================================
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED
==================================================

1. Support system architecture
2. Intelligent ticket & chat flow
3. AI Support Assistant logic
4. Support Agent Dashboard
5. Role-based permissions
6. Example usage flows
7. Clean separation between AI, UI, and logic

==================================================
FINAL STATEMENT
==================================================

This Support System must demonstrate the true intelligence
and power of Infra Web Nova.

It should feel like:
"An AI-powered operations command center"
—not a traditional helpdesk.

This is a production-grade system.
Do not simplify.
Do not hardcode.
Do not build a basic ticketing tool.
